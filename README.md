# Python Projects: Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe

This repository contains two interactive Python projects that aim to introduce fundamental programming concepts through classic games: Hangman and Tic-Tac-Toe. These projects are part of an educational initiative to enhance Python programming skills in a fun and engaging manner.

## Hangman (Job 01)

The `pendu.py` program allows users to play the Hangman game within the terminal. Players can choose difficulty levels that determine their number of lives. The program randomly selects words from a predefined dictionary, and players must guess the letters in the word. The game provides visual feedback on the remaining lives, guessed letters, and unguessed letters. The game ends when the player guesses the word or runs out of lives.

## Tic-Tac-Toe (Job 02)

The `morpion.py` program enables two players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the terminal. Players take turns to mark their symbol (X or O) on the grid, aiming to achieve a winning combination. After each game, the program stores the players' usernames and victory counts in a `score.txt` file. If a player's username already exists, their victory count is incremented; otherwise, a new entry is added to the file.
